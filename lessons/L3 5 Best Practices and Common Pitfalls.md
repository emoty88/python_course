# L3.5 Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices for Django Project Structure

1. **Follow the Django Project Layout:**
Stick to the default Django project structure as much as possible. It provides a clean separation of concerns and makes it easier to navigate the project.
2. **Use Virtual Environments:**
Always use a virtual environment for your Django projects. This helps to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts between packages.
3. **Keep Settings Modular:**
Split your `settings.py` file into multiple settings files (e.g., `base.py`, `development.py`, `production.py`). This helps manage different configurations for different environments.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```python
    settings/
        __init__.py
        base.py
        development.py
        production.py
    ```
    
4. **Write Reusable Apps:**
Write reusable and pluggable apps. This allows you to use the same app in multiple projects.
5. **Use Django Templates Wisely:**
Keep your templates clean and avoid putting too much logic in them. Use template inheritance to avoid redundancy.
6. **Optimize Database Queries:**
Use Django’s query optimization features like `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to minimize the number of database queries.
7. **Write Tests:**
Write tests for your Django applications. Use Django’s built-in testing framework to ensure your code is working as expected.
8. **Documentation:**
Keep your code well-documented. Use docstrings and comments to explain the purpose of your code.

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

1. **Hardcoding Sensitive Information:**
Never hardcode sensitive information like secret keys or passwords in your code. Use environment variables instead.
2. **Not Handling Static and Media Files Properly:**
Ensure that you are handling static and media files correctly, especially in production. Use a dedicated storage service like AWS S3 or Django’s built-in storage backends.
3. **Ignoring Security Best Practices:**
Always follow Django’s security best practices. This includes keeping Django up to date, using HTTPS, and protecting against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
4. **Ignoring Performance Optimization:**
Optimize your database queries and use caching to improve performance. Avoid loading too much data into memory at once.
5. **Poor Error Handling:**
Implement proper error handling in your views and middleware. Provide meaningful error messages and handle exceptions gracefully.
6. **Neglecting Tests:**
Not writing tests can lead to bugs and regressions. Make sure to write unit tests and integration tests for your applications.
7. **Overcomplicating Code:**
Keep your code simple and readable. Avoid overcomplicating your models, views, and templates.
