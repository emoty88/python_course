Q1: What have you accomplished that demonstrates progress against your goals? How has it impacted your team and/or the business?

A1: This year, I created a live Python course, complete with comprehensive content, to upskill my colleagues, who were primarily front-end engineers. The course covered Python, Django, and GraphQL, enabling many to transition into full-stack engineering roles. We recorded the course sessions and developed tutorial-like content and lessons for future reference. As a result, new hires or engineers aspiring to learn the Python stack can now access this resource to become proficient, enhancing team flexibility and fostering a stronger, more diverse skill set across the organization.

Additionally, as a senior engineer with expertise in Python, I collaborated with staff engineers to create technical design documents (TDDs) for new microservices. My contributions included clarifying domain-specific questions and providing guidance during the design process, ensuring robust and efficient service designs. This collaboration improved the quality of the microservices and fostered a culture of knowledge-sharing and teamwork.

I also took the initiative to investigate and evaluate the existing Python infrastructure for our new microservice architecture. Despite no prior experience, I connected with relevant teams, explored its capabilities, and identified potential challenges. Based on the findings, we decided to switch to the Java infrastructure, which proved to be a more robust and scalable solution for our needs. This proactive decision helped us avoid significant future issues and ensured the project's long-term success.

Furthermore, I mentored several team members, supporting their professional growth. One of the staff engineers specifically requested that I mentor a new hire. I am now working closely with her to provide guidance and help her integrate effectively into the team, ensuring her long-term success and contribution to the organization.

Q2: How have you demonstrated our core values along the way?

A2: Throughout the year, I demonstrated our core values by prioritizing collaboration, mentorship, and delivering impactful work. My efforts in creating the Python course advanced my team's technical capabilities and contributed to a culture of learning and innovation. By thoroughly investigating infrastructure capabilities for a critical project and proposing a strategic shift in the tech stack, I showcased a commitment to proactive problem-solving and integrity. Mentoring team members and supporting a new hire further emphasized my dedication to fostering growth and teamwork, ensuring individual and organizational success. These actions reflect my commitment to making a meaningful impact and upholding the principles that guide our organization.

Q3: What lessons have you learned this year, and what would you do differently? (What would you start, stop, continue?)

A3: This year, I learned the importance of being more proactive and initiating work without waiting for managerial direction. Moving forward, I plan to take the initiative to identify opportunities and drive solutions. For example, when planning new projects, I will create technical demos to showcase potential solutions and demonstrate their viability. This approach will help streamline decision-making and ensure our team adopts effective and efficient strategies. Additionally, I will continue leveraging my expertise to evaluate and recommend optimal solutions for complex technical challenges, ensuring long-term success for our projects.
